So, I got a very interesting problem(according to me atleast) in the same interview as Problem 1

Problem Statement:


  Given a series,
                 4 7 44 47 77 .... and so on
                 we will given a term of this series and we need to find out at what 1 based index that number will occur

My approach:

    I had solved some problems like this before with dp, where I get two number and I had to make a number, only by multiplying them.
    But here the case was totally different.

    Any term here could be represented by , 10^n*a1+10^(n-1)*a2......an+1 where ai belongs to [4,7]

    This surely didn't look solvable by any such methods, I though of binary search but still I would have to genetrate all number till that.
    I was already told the valses of number and corresponding n can be quite large.

    Hint: I was asked to work on the given input number.

    From here it was quite clear to me what I needed to do:

    1. Let suppose I get a number of size x, Then I have to just fill the boxes of size x with number {0,4,7}, limiting myself to 
       the upperbound number. This is just a variation of digit dp.
    2. I explained the thought process, I wasn't asked to code it.


Post Interview:

    After, the interview, I searched on the internet and I found out that is quite a popular question which can be solved by 
    what digit is last taken. But It was an O(n) approach not O(log10(n)) approach like mine. Maybe there exist a soln by that
    approach I am not sure.
